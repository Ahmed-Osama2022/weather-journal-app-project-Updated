# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project illustrate the concept of creating an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions

- Start by setting up your project environment. ``` install node packages required for the application. ```
- Adding a GET route that returns the ``` projectData ``` object in the server code.
- Then, adding a POST route that adds incoming data to ```projectData```.
- Acquire API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website. 
-

## Finally
- The main idea from this project is to show you how we can use JavaScript to interact with API's and how it can be used as asynchronous code. 
- And also how to deal with promises and fetch requests.
- I've used here the API from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/).
